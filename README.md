# Solving-N-Queens

Create a program, a0.py, with several additional features, including the ability to solve both the N-rooks and N-queens problems, and the ability to solve these problems when when exactly one
position on the board is unavailable (meaning that you cannot place a piece there). Your program must accept four arguments. The rst one is either nrook or nqueen, which signies the problem type. The
second is the number of rooks or queens (i.e., N). The last two arguments represent the coordinate of the unavailable position. For example, 2 3 means the square at the second row and the third column
is unavailable. Assuming a coordinate system where (1,1) is at the top-left of the board. R indicates the position of a rook, underscore marks an empty square, and X shows the unavailable
position. the Q's indicate the positions of queens on the board. As a special case, the coordinate 0 0 indicates that there are no unavailable squares. Please print only the solution in exactly the above
format and nothing else.
